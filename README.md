# Heatmap
Procedural Programming for Computer Science â€“ Winter Semester 2023/24
This project involves developing a program to generate a bitmap image (BMP) in the style of a heatmap from a given dataset. The dataset contains measurement data (x, y, z coordinates) captured by an underwater robot and stored in a CSV file.
The main goal is to visualize these measurements to help an expert team analyze the height profile of a riverbed.
